**Berhlgyn: Berhlgyn, usually going by the name Beryl among mortals, is a half-hag. Few know of her true heritage and those who do are careful with this information. Beryl can cast divination spells and place curses. Usually she’ll request something personal like a lock of hair, and something specific for the exact type of spell. However, she’s Chaotic Neutral and sometimes there are side effects of her spells: Her clients and victims both have suffered from it. Usually, it’s minor and she’ll keep working with them if the client plays along. When she’s bored though, the side effects can be deadly: Maybe the target of divination will have a vision of the client or the client will catch the same curse that they asked to place on the victim.**
