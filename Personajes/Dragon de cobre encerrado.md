**Cyprum: Cyprum is a young copper dragon. As selfish as copper dragons go when it comes to treasure, he tried to steal from an ancient gold dragon: “Golds don’t care so much about it. Also, what’s a rare coin for an ancient gold in such a vast treasure? Plus… he’s old. He won’t notice” he had thought. In return, the gold dragon placed a spell on the copper to teach him some manners: Cyprum can no longer leave his lair until he reaches adult age. To prevent abuse, the gold also placed strong wards that deny moving his current treasure away without the copper’s permission and also protected him against most harm. Cyprum now spends all day thinking of riddles and jokes and tries to lure adventurers via word of mouth to share the latest works of his imagination. He also has a lot of information and is excellent when it comes to magic items: He’s been studying a tome about various magic items religiously. In fact, he may ask adventurers to go on quests to bring him magic items and keep what they find on the way as a reward, in exchange for letting them know about the location.**
